# -OIBSIP INTERNSHIP-

Working on following projects during the internship:
- Developed supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms to analyze data to make predictions.
- Perform Exploratory data analysis and data preprocessing techniques like data wrangling, missing value treatment.
- Used Feature scaling to standardize the data by using Standard scaler, Minmax scaler method.
- Converting categorical data into numeric by using One Hot encoding, Label encoder method.
- Used cross validation technique to Find the better accuracy of the model.
